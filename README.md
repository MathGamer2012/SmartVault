## Smart Vault 

Bank application that provides an interface for the regular community to simulate a banking system. The application allows for the user to transfer their money into the bank account they open with us, 
review their balance, cashout the balance, interact with the stock market to earn vouchers, and finally have access to face recognition to gain safe access to their account.
